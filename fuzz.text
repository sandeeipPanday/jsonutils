- API endpoints: Testing input variations for functions handling requests (Flask or FastAPI endpoints).
- Database queries: Ensuring SQL data integrity under unexpected input (PostgreSQL integration).
- Authentication workflows: Validating SSO integration robustness (OAuth, JWT, session tokens).
- Data parsing utilities: Handling CVE data feeds without corruption (JSON processing scripts).
No problem, Sandeep! I'll break it down clearly.
How Dynamic Tests Get Created in Fuzz Testing
Dynamic testing‚Äîespecially fuzz testing‚Äîgenerates and executes test cases automatically to check how a program behaves under unexpected input conditions.
Here‚Äôs how it works step by step:
1. Define the Target for Testing
Before generating tests, we decide what to test.
For example, in your Python project:
- A function that processes user input (test_function(data))
- An API endpoint receiving HTTP requests (Flask API)
- A security workflow handling authentication (SSO integration)
2. Generate Randomized or Structured Inputs
Instead of manually writing test cases, fuzzing automatically creates inputs to uncover potential weaknesses.
This can include:
- Random bytes (b'\x00\xFF\xAB\xCD')
- Malicious patterns (b'"; DROP TABLE users;')
- Unicode edge cases (b"‰Ω†Â•Ω, üòä, „Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ")
- Boundary values (b"A" * 1000000)
A fuzzing tool like Atheris or pythonfuzz keeps feeding different variations into the target function.
3. Execute Tests Continuously
The fuzzing tool runs these inputs through your function:
- If the function raises an error or crashes, the test finds a weak point.
- If output seems incorrect, it logs unexpected behavior for debugging.
Example fuzzing execution:
import atheris
import sys

def test_function(data):
    if data == b"crash":
        raise Exception("Crash detected!")

def fuzz_entry_point():
    atheris.Setup(sys.argv, test_function)
    atheris.Fuzz()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    fuzz_entry_point()


Here, Atheris automatically mutates input to find edge cases.
4. Analyze Results & Improve Code
After running dynamic tests, we:
- Review logs of failures
- Identify patterns that cause crashes
- Fix vulnerable code sections
In automated pipelines, test results can be stored and reported dynamically.

Why This is Useful for Your Project
Since your work involves security workflows, API integration, and automation, fuzz testing helps: ‚úî Validate input sanitization
‚úî Prevent vulnerabilities in data parsing
‚úî Detect unexpected system behavior in CI/CD
